# CurrencyConverter
# My first programming side project.
This mobile application is a programming project that I have finished without any guides or tutorials walking me through; I created this application via Android Studio, using the programming language known as Java.
This application allows the user to see the conversion of various currencies. I have chosen up to 5 different currencies (GBP, USD, EUR, AUD, JPY) for the user to select.

This project helped me understand the basics of building an application, using XML and Java code to create a front-end (Graphical User Interface) and a back end.

I am exhilarated to learn and create more applications using Java and other programming languages.
