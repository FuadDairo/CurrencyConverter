# CurrencyConverter
This is my first programming project done without any "walkthrough tutorials".
This is an android application made via Android Studio with the programming language Java.
This application allows the user see the convertion of diffrent money. I chose 5 currencies (GBP,USD,EUR,AUD,JPY) for simplicity.
